It's a classic dine-in deli/restaurant. We have been a few times, and never disappointed. The potato knishes are delicious. In our most recent visit, I got a turkey pastrami sandwich, which was HUGE and so tasty. The roast beef is so good, especially since they top 2 giant potato pancakes with it. When you first sit down, you get a plate of pickles to start. Make sure you take a trip when you can. It's worth every penny! TIP: make sure to get a side of their homemade Russian dressing. It's AMAZING and you can put it on literally anything you want here.</q></p>

Is it a little run down and old fashioned?, yes, but its part of the charm.  Just roll with it.  So, on to the food, which is really great.  The matzoh ball soup and potato pancakes, very good.  Some outstanding sandwiches, the Black Russian, the Reuben, the Pastrami/Corned Beef Combo and the Hot Brisket.... The sandwiches are way too big, very generous portions.  I have had the coleslaw several times, fresh and crunchy, not sweet.  Excellent crunchy half sour pickles.  And of course they sell a variety of Dr. Brown's sodas, and they sell Tab!  They also sell big cookies - chocolate chip, linzer tarts, and a few other pastries, bagels, etc.  One note about the french fries, I have had both the sweet potato and the regular.  The sweet potato fries are always good, usually the same thing.  But the regular fries, always kind of weird, different cuts, shapes, not always crisp... they are never the same, kind of strange. If you like Jewish deli, this is your place.</q><!-- <br/> --></p>
